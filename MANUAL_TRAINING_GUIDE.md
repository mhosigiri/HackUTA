# üìö Manual Training Guide - Custom Document AI Processor

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Authentication Issue Detected

The service account credentials appear to have an invalid JWT signature. This can happen if:
- The credentials file is outdated
- The service account has been modified
- The key has been revoked

## üéØ Solution: Manual Upload & Training

Since automated upload is having issues, here's how to train your custom processor manually:

---

## Option 1: Fix Credentials & Use Automated Upload

### Step 1: Generate New Service Account Key

1. Go to Google Cloud Console:
   ```
   https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?project=652485593933
   ```

2. Find your service account: `mortgage-app-sa@docuextractmhosigiri.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

3. Click on it ‚Üí "Keys" tab ‚Üí "Add Key" ‚Üí "Create New Key"

4. Choose JSON format ‚Üí Download

5. Replace the old file:
   ```bash
   mv ~/Downloads/docuextractmhosigiri-*.json \
      /Users/arniskc/Documents/HackUTA/docuextractmhosigiri-4cc95bebf955.json
   ```

6. Run upload again:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/arniskc/Documents/HackUTA/backend
   python upload_training_data.py
   ```

---

## Option 2: Manual Upload via Console (Recommended)

### Step 1: Upload Images to GCS via Console

1. **Go to Cloud Storage**:
   ```
   https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser?project=652485593933
   ```

2. **Create Bucket**:
   - Click "Create Bucket"
   - Name: `invoice-training-652485593933`
   - Location: `us (multiple regions in United States)`
   - Storage class: Standard
   - Click "Create"

3. **Create Folder**:
   - Open the bucket
   - Click "Create Folder"
   - Name: `training-images`

4. **Upload Images**:
   - Open `training-images` folder
   - Click "Upload Files"
   - Navigate to: `/Users/arniskc/Documents/HackUTA/backend/training_dataset/`
   - Select all `.jpg` files (invoice_0000.jpg to invoice_0099.jpg)
   - Click "Upload"
   - Wait for upload to complete (~100 files)

### Step 2: Create Custom Processor

1. **Go to Document AI Console**:
   ```
   https://console.cloud.google.com/ai/document-ai?project=652485593933
   ```

2. **Create Processor**:
   - Click "Create Processor"
   - Select "Custom Document Extractor"
   - Processor name: `Custom Invoice Processor`
   - Region: `us (United States)`
   - Click "Create"

3. **Note the Processor ID**:
   - After creation, you'll see the processor details
   - Copy the Processor ID (format: `abc123def456...`)
   - Save it for later

### Step 3: Import Training Data

1. **Go to Train Tab**:
   - In your custom processor page
   - Click "Train" tab
   - Click "Import Data"

2. **Configure Import**:
   - Data source: "Cloud Storage"
   - Path: `gs://invoice-training-652485593933/training-images/`
   - Document type: "Invoice"
   - Click "Import"

3. **Wait for Import**:
   - Takes 5-10 minutes for 100 images
   - You'll see progress indicator

### Step 4: Define Schema

Configure the fields you want to extract:

**Basic Fields:**
- Invoice Number (text)
- Invoice Date (date)
- Due Date (date)
- Purchase Order Number (text)

**Vendor Information:**
- Vendor Name (text)
- Vendor Address (address)
- Vendor Phone (phone)
- Vendor Email (email)

**Customer Information:**
- Customer Name (text)
- Customer Address (address)
- Bill To Address (address)
- Ship To Address (address)

**Line Items (Table):**
- Description (text)
- Quantity (number)
- Unit Price (money)
- Amount (money)

**Totals:**
- Subtotal (money)
- Tax Amount (money)
- Tax Rate (number)
- Total Amount (money)
- Amount Due (money)

**Payment:**
- Payment Terms (text)
- Payment Method (text)

### Step 5: Label Training Data

1. **Auto-Labeling**:
   - Document AI will auto-label many fields
   - Review the suggestions

2. **Manual Labeling**:
   - Click on each document
   - Verify auto-labeled fields
   - Add missing labels
   - Correct any errors

3. **Labeling Tips**:
   - Label at least 50-100 documents for good accuracy
   - Be consistent with field names
   - Include variations (different invoice formats)
   - Mark ambiguous cases clearly

4. **Quality Check**:
   - Review labeled data
   - Ensure all required fields are labeled
   - Check for consistency

### Step 6: Train Model

1. **Start Training**:
   - Click "Train New Version"
   - Review configuration
   - Click "Start Training"

2. **Training Time**:
   - Typically 2-4 hours
   - Depends on dataset size and complexity
   - You'll receive email when complete

3. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Check "Versions" tab
   - See training status
   - View logs if needed

### Step 7: Evaluate Model

1. **Review Metrics**:
   - Accuracy score
   - Precision and recall per field
   - Confusion matrix

2. **Test with Samples**:
   - Upload test invoices
   - Check extraction quality
   - Compare with ground truth

3. **Iterate if Needed**:
   - If accuracy < 90%, add more labeled data
   - Focus on fields with low accuracy
   - Retrain with improved dataset

### Step 8: Deploy Model

1. **Deploy Version**:
   - Go to "Versions" tab
   - Find your trained version
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Confirm deployment

2. **Get Processor ID**:
   - Copy the Processor ID
   - Format: `abc123def456...`

3. **Update Application**:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env file
   nano /Users/arniskc/Documents/HackUTA/backend/.env
   
   # Update this line:
   DOCAI_PROCESSOR_ID=<your-new-processor-id>
   
   # Save and exit
   ```

4. **Restart Backend**:
   ```bash
   # Stop current backend
   lsof -ti :8000 | xargs kill -9
   
   # Start with new processor
   cd /Users/arniskc/Documents/HackUTA/backend
   ../backend/.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### Step 9: Test Custom Processor

1. **Upload Test Invoice**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Upload a real invoice
   - Check extracted data

2. **Verify Fields**:
   - All custom fields extracted?
   - Accuracy improved?
   - Compare with pre-trained processor

3. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Track extraction accuracy
   - Note any missing fields
   - Collect feedback

## Option 3: Use Current Pre-trained Processor

**If training is too complex**, your current setup already works well:

- ‚úÖ Pre-trained processor ID: `488eb737f920bc88`
- ‚úÖ 85-90% accuracy for standard invoices
- ‚úÖ No training required
- ‚úÖ Works immediately

**When to train custom processor:**
- Your invoices have unique formats
- Need to extract custom fields
- Require >95% accuracy
- Have time for 4-6 hour training process

---

## üìä Expected Results

### Pre-trained Processor (Current)
- Accuracy: 85-90%
- Setup time: 0 minutes
- Cost: $1.50 per 1,000 pages
- Good for: Standard invoices

### Custom Processor (After Training)
- Accuracy: 95-98%
- Setup time: 4-6 hours
- Cost: $10 per 1,000 pages
- Good for: Your specific invoice formats

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Invalid JWT Signature"
- Service account key is invalid/expired
- Generate new key from IAM console
- Replace old credentials file

### "Permission Denied"
- Service account needs Storage Admin role
- Add role in IAM console
- Wait 1-2 minutes for propagation

### "Billing Not Enabled"
- Enable billing on project
- Go to Billing console
- Link credit card

### "Import Failed"
- Check GCS path is correct
- Verify images are valid
- Ensure bucket permissions
