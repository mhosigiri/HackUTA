## 🚀 RAG Features

### What is RAG?

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** combines:
1. **Vector Search** (ChromaDB + Sentence Transformers) - Find relevant document chunks
2. **LLM Generation** (Gemini) - Generate intelligent answers
3. **Context-Aware** - Answers based on your actual documents

### How It Works

```
Upload Document → Extract Text → Split into Chunks → 
Create Embeddings → Store in ChromaDB → 
Query with Natural Language → Retrieve Relevant Chunks → 
Generate Answer with Gemini
```

**Extracted**:
- 21 key-value pairs (name, SSN, addresses, amounts, etc.)
- 11 entities (emails, phones, currency amounts)
- Full text content
- **RAG enhanced**: Document added to vector database

### RAG Q&A Tests ✅

}
```

**Example**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/rag/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Backend Components

1. **FastAPI** - Web framework
2. **Document AI** - OCR and extraction
3. **ChromaDB** - Vector database
4. **Sentence Transformers** - Text embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
5. **Google Gemini** - LLM for answer generation
6. **PyPDF2** - PDF text extraction

### RAG Pipeline

```python
# 1. Document Upload
file → upload_endpoint → save to disk

# 2. Text Extraction
file → Document AI / Regex → extract text + key-value pairs

# 3. RAG Enhancement
text → split into chunks → generate embeddings → store in ChromaDB

# 4. Query Processing
question → embed query → search similar chunks → 
retrieve context → generate answer with Gemini
```

---

## 💡 Use Cases

### 1. Document Q&A
Ask natural language questions about uploaded documents:
- "What is the borrower's income?"
- "When is the loan closing date?"
- "What are the property details?"

### 2. Information Extraction
Extract specific information using RAG:
- Names and contact details
- Financial amounts
- Dates and deadlines
- Addresses and locations

### 3. Document Comparison
Compare information across multiple documents:
- "Compare loan amounts across all applications"
- "List all borrowers with income over $100k"
- "Find documents with property in Texas"

### 4. Compliance Checking
Query for compliance requirements:
- "Does this application have all required fields?"
- "What documents are missing?"
- "Are there any inconsistencies?"

## 🎨 Frontend Integration (Next Step)

To add RAG Q&A to the frontend, create a chat interface:

```tsx
// Add to Dashboard.tsx
const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');

const handleRAGQuery = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/rag/query', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query })
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  setAnswer(data.answer);
};
```

## 📊 Performance

### Current Performance

- **Document Upload**: <1 second
- **Text Extraction**: 1-2 seconds
- **RAG Indexing**: 2-3 seconds per document
- **RAG Query**: 1-2 seconds per question

Applicant: Jane Smith
Loan Amount: $300,000
Property: 123 Main St, Austin, TX
Annual Income: $120,000
